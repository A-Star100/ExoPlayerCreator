# ExoPlayer Creator
An Android app that can create ExoPlayer video players and HTML5 video players instantly, developed in MIT App Inventor.

ExoPlayer Creator uses the [ExoPlayer for App Inventor](https://github.com/zainulhassan815/exoplayer-appinventor) extension to create ExoPlayer initializations, and is a modified version of the 1.0.4 AIA version of the [ExoPlayer for App Inventor demo](https://github.com/zainulhassan815/exoplayer-appinventor/blob/v2.0/aia/exoplayer_v1.0.4.aia).
