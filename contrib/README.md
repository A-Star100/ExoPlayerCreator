# contrib
This branch is for contributions to the source code. The source code should be read from the *main* branch. Any contributions, or modified versions of the same software will be here,
with different folders for different authors. **You should NOT make pull requests for contributions in the main branch, you can only do that in this branch**.

If your contribution pleases reviewers enough, it will eventually be added to the *main* branch and be included with **all** releases of the app from then.
